// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain



//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added."
const analysisOfRequirements = "This second step determines the requirements needed for the software to be able to do what was planned. This is also where the necessary resources are also defined."
const design = "This is the process of determining how all the components of the design and requirements will fit together on a high level. This can also include prototyping and the base architecture of the project."
const implementation = "This step is the process of developing the actual software. The development will be based off of the prior steps."
const testingAndIntegration = "This step utilizes the product from the prior step and checks for any bugs. These are then fixed and retested."
const maintain = "After deployment, the software typically has changes based on reports from users and any bugs that may have been missed during the testing phase."
